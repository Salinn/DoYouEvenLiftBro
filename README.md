================

This is a project for Human Computer Interactions in which we are focusing on creating a use able front end and not focusing as much on the backed.

There were some patterns utilized in this design but overall we were focused on the front end and not the backend and designed the front end and made the backend work. This created problems that we dealt with but left us with some bad code that if this project was ever moved forward would be redone before conintinuing. 

I learned from this that designing the backend is more important because the front end just hooks up to the backend and if we design the front end and start coding without talking about how all of the data will be passed around then it will lead to badd programming
